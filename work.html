    <h2 class="title-header"><br>Work at Matrix</h2>
    <h5 class="heading-4"><br>About<br>‚Äç</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-3">Matrix is building Robinhood and NASDAQ for esports and the digital economy.<br>‚Äç<br>Esport teams and creators can sell shares of themselves to their fans. Their fans can then vote, receive dividends, and more. This creates an unprecedented amount of <br>engagement between fan and team and unlocks an entirely new form of viewership.<br><br>Matrix becomes a game in and of itself. We want our users to enjoy using Matrix just as much as League of Legends, Fortnite, or any other game.<br>‚Äç</p>
    <h5 class="heading-4">Beliefs<br>‚Äç</h5>
    <div class="text-block-2"><span><strong class="bold-text-2">üîë Ownership</strong></span></div>
    <p class="paragraph-3"><br>Ownership is powerful. It provides pride, wealth, and loyalty. However, today, the feeling of ownership has all but disappeared. We rent our cars, our houses, and our entertainment. Saddled with debt, we hardly even own ourselves. <br><br>Matrix allows people to regain ownership. We are now able to truly own our entertainment and profit from what we watch.<br><br>Ownership extends into our workplace culture as well. We believe in allowing you to take charge of your projects and be responsible for it&#x27;s success and setbacks.<br>‚Äç</p>
    <div class="text-block-3"><strong class="bold-text-3">üéô ¬†Creation</strong></div>
    <div class="text-block-4"><br>We seek to empower creators. Matrix is fundamentally a tool that allows teams and creators to fund themselves through their fans. Instead of selling out to rich suits in boardrooms, they&#x27;re able to support themselves with their community and build exactly what their fans want to see.<br><br>This also means that we&#x27;re devoted to building a great product. If we&#x27;re looking to empower creators to do their best work, we need to build them something incredible. While perfection is never reachable, it is always our goal.<br>‚Äç</div>
    <div class="text-block-5">‚ù§Ô∏è Safety<br>‚Äç</div>
    <div class="text-block-6">If we&#x27;re creating a platform that&#x27;s going to take over the world, we need and want to build something that is safe for everyone to use. We seek to mitigate all unintended negative effects of our product.<br>‚Äç<br>This means we won&#x27;t turn a blind eye to societal issues and use &quot;neutrality&quot; as a defense. Instead, we seek to tackle these issues head on and consider how Matrix is affected and can be a solution to them.<br>‚Äç<br>In order to do so, safety also extends into our team culture. We&#x27;re building a workplace where everyone can feel safe in sharing their ideas and concerns.</div>
    <h5 class="text-block-5"><br>‚ú® Fun!<br>‚Äç</h5>
    <p class="paragraph-3">You&#x27;ve just done some pretty intense reading. Yes, we&#x27;re here to change entertain and the world forever. But, we&#x27;re also going to have fun doing it. We&#x27;re a chill group that doesn&#x27;t take ourselves too seriously. We game together and enjoy each other&#x27;s company quite a lot.</p>
